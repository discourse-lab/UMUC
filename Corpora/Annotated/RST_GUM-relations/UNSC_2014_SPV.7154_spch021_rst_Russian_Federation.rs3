		<segment id="14" parent="148" relname="span">but of course the most unfair of all came from our Ukrainian colleague,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="14" relname="elaboration">who accused Russia of terrorism.</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="151" relname="span">Why did he not accuse those who terrorized his Government for months on end, up to 21 February, of terrorism?</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="150" relname="span">They were people who really did terrorize the forces of law and order,</segment>

		<segment id="22" parent="155" relname="span">that, unfortunately, several clumsy accusations have been made against Russia.</segment>

		<segment id="48" parent="178" relname="span">We have absolutely no interest in doing such a thing,</segment>

		<segment id="62" parent="61" relname="elaboration">somehow such tactics were unacceptable.</segment>
		<segment id="63" parent="188" relname="span">A month and a half elapsed between 21 February and 6 April;</segment>
		<segment id="64" parent="187" relname="span">a month and a half had gone by since the overthrow of President Yanukovych and the conclusion of the agreement</segment>
		<segment id="65" parent="64" relname="elaboration">that could have prevented an escalation of the situation.</segment>
		<segment id="66" parent="189" relname="attribution">From the very beginning, all we said was</segment>

		<segment id="70" parent="69" relname="organization">Was any such gesture made?</segment>
		<segment id="71" parent="266" relname="joint">Finally, Mr. Yatsenyuk came,</segment>
		<segment id="72" parent="266" relname="joint">said something</segment>
		<segment id="73" parent="266" relname="joint">and left.</segment>
		<segment id="74" parent="193" relname="joint">Then Mr. Turchynov came the next day</segment>
		<segment id="75" parent="193" relname="joint">and did not seem to agree with him.</segment>
		<segment id="76" parent="192" relname="elaboration">It seemed they preferred to use force.</segment>
		<segment id="77" parent="213" relname="span">Incidentally, some very worrying tones have crept into our numerous contacts with our Western colleagues.</segment>
		<segment id="78" parent="79" relname="attribution">As the Council knows,</segment>
		<segment id="79" parent="203" relname="span">our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, has been talking to Secretary of State Kerry on the phone almost every day.</segment>
		<segment id="80" parent="204" relname="organization">Kerry continually claims to understand our concern</segment>

		<segment id="83" parent="207" relname="joint">And then suddenly one ofthe United States Deputy Secretaries of State gets up in Congress</segment>

		<segment id="88" parent="87" relname="restatement">"Occupy the time."</segment>
		<segment id="89" parent="213" relname="elaboration">So, really, maybe somebody in Washington, DC, is thinking about Turchynov's military offensive scenario.</segment>
		<segment id="90" parent="215" relname="span">In which case, there is no need to accuse Russia of attempting destabilization.</segment>
		<segment id="91" parent="92" relname="attribution">The representative of the United States noted</segment>
		<segment id="92" parent="216" relname="span">that Vice-President Biden will be going to Ukraine, it seems, on 21 April.</segment>
		<segment id="93" parent="217" relname="span">But maybe he should not wait for 21 April.</segment>
		<segment id="94" parent="218" relname="span">Maybe he should go right now.</segment>
		<segment id="95" parent="219" relname="joint">Pick up the phone,</segment>
		<segment id="96" parent="263" relname="span">call Mr. Turchynov</segment>
		<segment id="97" parent="96" relname="elaboration">- as he called President Yanukovych more than once before 21 February -</segment>
		<segment id="98" parent="219" relname="joint">and say to him what he said to Mr. Yanukovych.</segment>
		<segment id="99" parent="100" relname="attribution">As we were informed by the Vice-President's Chief of Staff,</segment>
		<segment id="100" parent="221" relname="span">he said,</segment>

		<segment id="102" parent="101" relname="restatement">Call off your forces from the centre of Kyiv".</segment>
		<segment id="103" parent="222" relname="restatement">That was what Mr. Biden said.</segment>
		<segment id="104" parent="226" relname="span">And now, is the United States going to encourage the fulfilment of this criminal decree</segment>
		<segment id="105" parent="104" relname="elaboration">authorizing the use of military force?</segment>
		<segment id="106" parent="227" relname="span">Why, in one case,</segment>
		<segment id="107" parent="106" relname="elaboration">when it was a question of preparations to storm the residence of the President of Ukraine,</segment>
		<segment id="108" parent="228" relname="span">the call was that under no circumstances should force be used,</segment>
		<segment id="109" parent="229" relname="span">while in the current situation, it is to encourage the insane military actions</segment>
		<segment id="110" parent="109" relname="elaboration">that Turchynov's decree talks about?</segment>
		<segment id="111" parent="233" relname="span">I would therefore request Ms. Power to ask Vice-President Biden to call Mr. Turchynov right now,</segment>
		<segment id="112" parent="111" relname="explanation">because in a few hours' time things might take an irreversible turn.</segment>
		<segment id="113" parent="235" relname="span">Many colleagues mentioned the meeting</segment>
		<segment id="114" parent="113" relname="elaboration">that was announced for 17 April.</segment>
		<segment id="115" parent="236" relname="span">Indeed, for some months now,</segment>
		<segment id="116" parent="115" relname="elaboration">in particular during the period after 21 February,</segment>
		<segment id="117" parent="238" relname="span">we have constantly encouraged such formats for dialogue as a possible way</segment>
		<segment id="118" parent="117" relname="purpose">to achieve a solution to the crisis.</segment>
		<segment id="119" parent="264" relname="span">We agreed in principle that the meeting would take place among the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Secretary of State Kerry, Ms. Ashton and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="120" parent="239" relname="attribution">We very much hope</segment>
		<segment id="121" parent="239" relname="joint">that such a high-level meeting will encourage a broad political dialogue in Ukraine</segment>

		<segment id="123" parent="247" relname="span">But what does the Council think?</segment>
		<segment id="124" parent="125" relname="contingency-condition">If armed force is used and hostilities take place tomorrow,</segment>
		<segment id="125" parent="244" relname="span">are we really going to sign off on that meeting?</segment>
		<segment id="126" parent="245" relname="span">Of course, that initiative is going to be fundamentally undermined</segment>
		<segment id="127" parent="126" relname="contingency-condition">if military operations are commenced in south-eastern Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="128" parent="248" relname="span">Please, let us refrain from any accusations or speculation</segment>
		<segment id="129" parent="128" relname="elaboration">as to why Russia is trying to do what it is doing.</segment>
		<segment id="130" parent="249" relname="joint">Let us focus our attention on what we can actually do in this case.</segment>
		<segment id="131" parent="252" relname="context-circumstance">Here I am speaking to my Western colleagues.</segment>
		<segment id="132" parent="265" relname="span">Let us ensure that we do not permit the Ukrainian authorities to commit the reckless actions</segment>
		<segment id="133" parent="132" relname="elaboration">that are currently enshrined in the criminal decree by Mr. Turchynov,</segment>
		<segment id="134" parent="250" relname="joint">and let us stop that decree from being implemented.</segment>
		<segment id="135" parent="250" relname="evaluation-comment">That would have extremely significant consequences, first and foremost for the people of Ukraine, of course.</segment>
