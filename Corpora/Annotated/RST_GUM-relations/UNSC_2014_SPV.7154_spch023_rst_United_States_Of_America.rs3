		<segment id="1" parent="2" relname="adversative">I will be brief,</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="39" relname="span">but in response to my colleague from the Russian Federation, I would like to say just a few things.</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="40" relname="span">First, the United States has constantly called for de-escalation and urged restraint.</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="44" relname="span">That has been our consistent policy.</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="6" relname="attribution">Our consistent statements have made clear</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="42" relname="span">that military force is not the answer,</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="41" relname="span">and we have commended the Ukrainians, frankly, for enduring more than probably any country in the United Nations could or would endure</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="7" relname="elaboration">without using force.</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="45" relname="span">Therefore, there have been no shortage of efforts at diplomacy.</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="11" relname="adversative">Secondly, it is not the United States that has escalated the situation,</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="46" relname="span">it is the Russian Federation.</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="50" relname="adversative">Thirdly, while we would like to place our faith in talks with the Russian Federation, the European Union and Ukraine,</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="48" relname="span">it is hard to reconcile the behaviour of the Russian Federation, the propaganda of the Russian Federation and the military actions of the Russian Federation</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">- which range from the massing of 40,000 troops on the border to the subversive activities inside Ukraine -</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="49" relname="span">with their appeal for diplomacy and de-escalation.</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration">It is an appeal that we wish were in fact sincere.</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="56" relname="joint">Fourthly, a few times, the representative of the Russian Federation has described what is happening in the eastern cities as protests and demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="53" relname="attribution">I would refer back to my French colleague's comment</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="53" relname="span">that those claims are rooted in some idea</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="54" relname="joint">that the Internet does not exist</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="55" relname="joint">and that people cannot see for themselves that they are not protests</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="55" relname="joint">and they are not demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="57" relname="span">They are professional forces</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="58" relname="span">carrying weapons</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">- Russian-made weapons, as it happens -</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="59" relname="joint">and carrying out sophisticated, coordinated military operations across a substantial number of eastern Ukrainian cities.</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="60" relname="joint">They are not demonstrations.</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="60" relname="joint">They are not protests.</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="61" relname="span">They are military operations.</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="64" relname="adversative">Finally, the credibility of the Russian Federation has been gravely undermined.</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="64" relname="span">That said, we remain eager and willing to talk about how to de-escalate the situation.</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="66" relname="span">That will require that the Russian Federation pull back its forces,</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration">which are ominously stationed and massed at the eastern Ukrainian border.</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="70" relname="joint">It will require that the Russian Federation work to de-escalate the situation in the light of the armed takeover of those buildings.</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="67" relname="joint">If, in fact, the Russian Federation is interested in peace</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="67" relname="joint">and in upholding its role as an enforcer of international peace and security,</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="69" relname="span">then it will engage quickly and with a wholly different degree of conviction, urgency and truthfulness</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="37" relname="context-circumstance">than it has up to this point.</segment>
