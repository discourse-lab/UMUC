		<segment id="1" parent="53" relname="context-circumstance">Many times, we have put forth in this Chamber the essence of the Russian position regarding the cause and development of the internal crisis in Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="2" parent="52" relname="span">That general context is important</segment>
		<segment id="3" parent="50" relname="span">to understanding our view of the draft resolution</segment>
		<segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">submitted by the United States</segment>
		<segment id="5" parent="50" relname="explanation">(S/2014/189)</segment>
		<segment id="6" parent="53" relname="same-unit">for the Council's vote today.</segment>
		<segment id="7" parent="57" relname="span">It is a secret to no one that the Russian Federation will vote against the draft resolution.</segment>
		<segment id="8" parent="55" relname="span">We cannot go along with its basic assumption,</segment>
		<segment id="9" parent="56" relname="span">which is to declare illegal the planned referendum of 16 March</segment>
		<segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration">whereby the people of the Crimean republic will themselves determine their future.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="58" relname="span">The philosophy of the sponsors of the draft resolution runs counter to one of basic principles of international law, the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations.</segment>
		<segment id="13" parent="59" relname="span">That principle is confirmed in the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law</segment>
		<segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,</segment>
		<segment id="15" parent="60" relname="joint">and in a number of other decisions of the General Assembly,</segment>
		<segment id="16" parent="60" relname="joint">as well as the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.</segment>
		<segment id="17" parent="64" relname="span">We do not dispute the principle of the territorial integrity of States.</segment>
		<segment id="18" parent="17" relname="explanation">It is indeed very important.</segment>
		<segment id="19" parent="92" relname="span">It is also understandable that the enjoyment of the right to self-determination involving separation from an existing State is an extraordinary measure,</segment>
		<segment id="20" parent="19" relname="elaboration">applied when further coexistence within a single State becomes impossible.</segment>
		<segment id="21" parent="65" relname="span">Moreover,</segment>
		<segment id="22" parent="21" relname="elaboration">as practice has demonstrated,</segment>
		<segment id="23" parent="66" relname="joint">in the majority of cases, the realization ofpeoples' right to self-determination is achieved without the agreement of the central authorities of the State.</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="70" relname="causal">With respect to Crimea, that case resulted from a legal vacuum</segment>
		<segment id="25" parent="70" relname="span">generated by an unconstitutional armed coup d'etat</segment>
		<segment id="26" parent="69" relname="joint">carried out in Kyiv by radical nationalists in February,</segment>
		<segment id="27" parent="69" relname="joint">as well as by their direct threats to impose their order throughout Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="28" parent="72" relname="joint">It should also be noted that generally agreed principles of international law are closely interlinked</segment>
		<segment id="29" parent="72" relname="joint">and that each should be considered in the light of the others, the relevant political context and historic specificities.</segment>
		<segment id="30" parent="73" relname="span">The political, legal and historic backdrop of the events of today in Ukraine is extremely complicated.</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="74" relname="span">In that context, it is useful to recall that up until 1954, Crimea formed part of the Russian Federation.</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="76" relname="joint">It was given to Ukraine in violation of the norms of that time under Soviet law</segment>
		<segment id="33" parent="75" relname="span">and without taking into account the views of the people of Crimea,</segment>
		<segment id="34" parent="33" relname="elaboration">who nevertheless remained within a single State - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</segment>
		<segment id="35" parent="77" relname="span">When the Soviet Union fell, Crimea automatically became part of Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="36" parent="35" relname="causal">The View of the people of Crimea was once again ignored.</segment>
		<segment id="37" parent="79" relname="span">After the fall of the Soviet Union, for more than 20 years Crimea attempted to exercise its right to self-determination.</segment>
		<segment id="38" parent="80" relname="span">In January 1991, a referendum was conducted in Crimea,</segment>
		<segment id="39" parent="38" relname="causal">resulting in the adoption of a law in Ukraine regarding the establishment of autonomous Crimea.</segment>
		<segment id="40" parent="82" relname="joint">In September 1991, the High Council of Crimea adopted a declaration on State sovereignty.</segment>
		<segment id="41" parent="81" relname="span">In 1992, the constitution of Crimea was adopted,</segment>
		<segment id="42" parent="41" relname="causal">declaring Crimea an independent state within Ukraine.</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="83" relname="span">However, in 1995,</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="43" relname="causal">through a decision of the Ukrainian authorities and the President of Ukraine,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="84" relname="same-unit">the constitution was annulled, without the agreement of the Crimean people.</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="86" relname="span">We set out a number of other arguments in favour of the legality of the Crimean referendum at the Council meeting on 13 March</segment>
		<segment id="47" parent="46" relname="explanation">(see S/PV.7134).</segment>
		<segment id="48" parent="49" relname="attribution">In conclusion, we wish to confirm</segment>
		<segment id="49" parent="87" relname="span">that we will respect the will of the Crimean people during the referendum of 16 March.</segment>
