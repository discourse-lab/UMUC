		<segment id="10" parent="63" relname="contrast">In that regard, we view as unacceptable attempts to dictate to African Governments settlement recipes without their consent or request.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="62" relname="joint">We welcome the increased activity by Africans themselves with regard to emergency response,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="62" relname="joint">as well as the growing participation by African women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.</segment>

		<segment id="34" parent="84" relname="explanation">We should aim at achieving real results.</segment>
