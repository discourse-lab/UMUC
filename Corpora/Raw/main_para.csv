As the Council may be aware, 12 Indonesian citizens were confirmed among the deceased. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims.

It should come together behind a clear demand that the armed separatist groups should lay down their arms and pursue whatever political legitimate objectives they may have through exclusively peaceful and democratic means, and that the flow of arms, fighters and logistical support to the armed separatists be fully halted and the borders secured.

That could happen only if one of the parties possessed sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry.
Moreover, this unprecedented deterioration is also due to the presence of armed fighters coming from outside Ukraine. The question of outside support in terms of recruitment, supplies of materials and training cannot be avoided. The answer is too obvious. It is irrefutable."

They have fully demonstrated that ""restraint"" now. There have been indiscriminate air strikes, rocket fire and attacks by artillery tanks in Donetsk and Luhansk. This punitive operation is becoming increasingly destructive for the civilian population and infrastructure. Dozens of civilians have been killed, including children. Transport systems, community facilities and medical centres have been destroyed."

The airliner was travelling at a cruise altitude of 33,000 feet, and its speed was typical for an airliner along an established flight corridor frequented by commercial traffic. The flight was transmiting its assigned transponder code, corresponding with its flight plan, and flight tracking data was publicly available on the Internet.

We can rule out shorter-range SAMSs known to be in separatist hands, including man-portable air defence systems, and SA-8 and SA-13 systems, which are not capable of hitting an aircraft at that altitude. Early Thursday, an SA-ll SAM. system was reported near Zahnitkiv by a western reporter, and separatists were spotted hours before the incident with an SA-Il system at a location close to the site where the plane went down."

Separatist leaders also boasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted those messages. Because of the technical complexity of the SA-11, it is unlikely that the separatists could effectively operate the system without assistance from knowledgeable personnel. Therefore, we cannot rule out technical assistance from Russian personnel in operating the systems. The Ukrainians do have SA-ll systems in their inventory; however, we are not aware of any Ukrainian SAM. systems in the area of the shoot-down. More important, since the beginning of the crisis Ukrainian air defences have not fired a single missile, despite several alleged violations of their airspace by Russian aircraft."

On 13 June, separatists shot down a Ukrainian transport plane carrying 40 paratroopers and 9 crew members. On 24 June, as the Council was meeting to welcome Ukraine's unilateral ceasefire (see S/PV.7205), we received word that separatists had downed a Ukrainian helicopter, killing all nine aboard. On 14 July, separatists claimed credit for downing a Ukrainian military cargo plane flying at 6,000 metres. And on 16 July they claimed credit for the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet.

In the past few weeks, Russia has increased the number of tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers in south-west Russia. More advanced air defence systems have also arrived. Moscow recently transferred Soviet- era tanks and artillery to the separatists, and several military vehicles crossed the border. After recapturing several Ukrainian cities last weekend, Ukrainian officials discovered caches of weapons long associated with Russian stockpiles, including MANPADs, mines, grenades, meals ready to eat, vehicles and a pontoon bridge. Ukrainian forces have discovered large amounts of other Russian-provided military equipment, including accompanying documentation verifying Russian origin, in the areas they have liberated from separatists in recent days.
Recruiting efforts for separatist fighters are expanding inside Russia, and separatists have openly said that they were looking for volunteers with experience in operating heavy weapons such as tanks and air defences.
Russia has allowed officials from the Donetsk People's Republic to establish a recruiting office in Moscow.
Ukrainian pilot Nadia Savchenko, who has long had a distinguished career in the Ukrainian military, was taken by separatists in mid-June. She is now being held - where? - in a prison in Voronezh, Russia.
According to the Ukrainian Government, she was transferred to Russia by separatists. Russia continues to redeploy new forces extremely close to the Ukrainian border. In addition, on Monday, a Ukrainian air force cargo plane was shot down in Ukrainian air space, and on Wednesday a Ukrainian fighter jet was also shot down in Ukrainian air space.

Throughout the past few months, Ukraine has demonstrated its commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and to implementing the agreements concluded, in particular the joint declaration adopted on 17 April in Geneva between Ukraine, Russia, the European Union and the United States. Ukraine has established a national dialogue and guarantees for national minorities. Once elected, President Poroshenko put forward a comprehensive peace plan and put in place a unilateral ceasefire to create the conditions necessary for its implementation.

However, in just a matter of days, there was a resumption ofthe so-called counter-terrorist, but actually punitive, operations - out and out violations of that agreement. In the south-east, there was a deployment of roughly 15,000 military personnel, tanks, armed vehicles, artillery, aircraft and subdivisions of Right Sector Banderists. As the first attempts to bring military pressure to bear on the south-east led to the defection of some Ukrainian military to the side of the protesters, today the sub-units are staffed by those from the west of the country. One might wonder what political and psychological effect that has had on the south-east and how it ties in with the task of ensuring the territorial integrity of the country.
In Geneva, it seemed that there was a window of opportunity for a significant de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine at the beginning of broad national dialogue. However, almost immediately following the declarations and actions of the Kyiv Government authorities, it became clear that they had no intention of implementing the agreement, just as they did not intend to implement the agreement of 21 February.
In both cases, that treachery led to bloodshed.
Unfortunately, it is difficulty to speak of confidence in the current coalition in Kyiv when the defence and law-enforcement agencies are essentially controlled by the Svoboda Party, whose political platform is based on declarations issued by Nazi collaborators in June 1941. Pursuant to those declarations, real Ukrainians should have collaborated with Hitler to establish a new order in Europe. I would recall that the collaborators and the followers of Bandera killed not only Jews, Poles and Soviet soldiers but also Ukrainians who refused to subscribe to their sloganeering."

Neither the Right Sector with its Nazi slogans nor any other radical organizations have laid down their arms. On the contrary, those groups have become legal. They are forming military battalions with names like Dnepr and Donbass in their ranks. How could the militias in the east be convinced to disarm or vacate buildings if they have been surrounded, as has happened in Sloviansk, by subdivisions of the Ukrainian armed forces and the so-called National Guard, comprised of fighters from the Right Sector."

The monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) confirm that he was tortured and that he is now engaged in an indefinite hunger strike. Mr. Gubarev is far from being the only political prisoner of the Kyiv regime.

My colleague from the United Kingdom rushed to say that the protesters in the south-east participated in that crime. That demands a careful investigation of the case. Let us not try to prejudge the outcome. It is true that Mr. Kernes had indeed spoken out about the chaos in other regions of Ukraine, and there were serious political battles between him and one of the heads of the defence and law-enforcement agencies. On the same day - 28 April - at the Kherson airport, the presidential candidate's plane was blocked. He had been travelling as part ofthe presidential campaign. He was attacked. In early April another candidate, Oleh Tsarev, was severely beaten. He was the only candidate for the presidential election without State protection.
Mr. Tsarev was stripped of his right to participate in the televised debates. In that context, can we speak about the peaceful nature of the electoral campaign in Ukraine and of freedom of expression for its civilians? The key point of the Geneva agreement was broad national dialogue, which was to take into account the interests of all regions and political formations.
The Kyiv Government made certain promises with regard to constitutional reforms and upholding the rights of minorities. But what about national dialogue and reform? According to meadia reports, today Mr. Yatsenyuk submitted to the Rada some sort of draft constitution. It is not really clear how it was prepared.
What is certain is that it was not an open and inclusive process. In fact, the Party of Regions, which represents the rest of the east of the country, was excluded from the process. It is no surprise that the draft was immediately criticized in the Rada by all sides. We did not hear any reasonable answers to key questions, such as how the federalization or decentralization of the country would take place. It seems such things are to be substituted by some type of broadening of municipalities. How is the issue of the status of the Russian language to be resolved? Can anyone seriously assert that all those activities by Kyiv are a solution to the political crisis aimed at stabilizing Ukraine? Instead of genuine collective work to bring Ukraine out of the crisis, which was brought about by political misadventurism, our colleagues from the United States and the European Union have preferred to make strong insinuations against Russia and thinking up some sort of sanctions that are pointless and counterproductive. Perhaps they are satisfactory to some one, but the responsibility for the future of Ukraine, Europe and the world is not being considered - at least not by these people."

A pro-unity rally was attacked by men in military fatigues, leading to over a dozen injuries among pro-Ukrainian protesters. A few days ago, a Ukrainian helicopter was downed by a rocket-propelled grenade, hardly a weapon so-called peaceful protesters - as labelled by the Russian side - can buy at the local corner market.
That certainly does not sound like the implementation of Geneva agreement by the separatists and their state sponsors? Displays of brutal force, beatings, disappearances, torture, killings and hostage-taking have become a daily reality in eastern Ukraine under militant separatist rule. While quick to condemn and brand Ukrainian authorities for alleged crimes, Russia has yet to issue a single condemnation of the violence carried out by armed separatists.

Russian special forces do not even hide anymore. Some time ago, our Russian colleague denied their involvement in Crimea, while his President recognized it a few days later. No doubt, he will do the same with respect to current events in Ukraine.
France strongly and unequivocally condemns those unacceptable attempts by Russia to destabilize Ukraine. We must halt this course of confrontation and work towards de-escalation. The joint declaration agreed on in Geneva on 17 April by Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union shows the way forward. It calls on all parties to refrain from violence and acts of intimidation or provocation. It provides for the disarmament of illegal armed groups, evacuation of occupied buildings and public places and amnesty for those who lay down their arms, with the exception of individuals with blood on their hands.
It is essential that the declaration be implemented by all parties without delay and in good faith, so that the Ukrainian State can re-establish its sovereignty over its territory. The OSCE's special monitoring mission has been asked to play an important role in implementing those de-escalation measures, and it is essential that it be allowed to act without hindrance."

On the one hand, the Ukrainian Government has shown its good faith in implementing the declaration by drafting an amnesty law, launching the process of constitutional reform and accelerating the dismantling of barricades and armed groups in Kyiv. In that regard, I commend the restraint and composure of the Ukrainian security forces, who have responded appropriately to the repeated destabilizing actions they are dealing with. We can only imagine what any other Government would have done in the face of such provocation on its national territory."

There has been no appeal to the pro-Russian militants to exercise restraint and end their attacks on munitions depots and on their compatriots, some of whom are said to have been tortured, and on journalists as well. Far from condemning those who took the OSCE observers hostage, today Russia is calling the mission's presence in eastern Ukraine a provocation.

It initiated constitutional reform. It approved the concept of local administrative reform, whose main principles are decentralizing power in the country, significantly empowering local communities and improving management at the regional and district levels. A draft law on amnesty for participants in the uprisings in the eastern regions has been prepared and would apply to those protesters who surrender their weapons and evacuate illegally seized administrative buildings, except for those suspected of committing serious crimes. The parliamentary coalition has invited all political parties represented in the Ukrainian Parliament to sign a memorandum of understanding on ways to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine.

The Russian leadership has done nothing to publicly dissociate itself from the armed separatists and provocateurs or to urge them to immediately lay down their arms and release captured administrative buildings.

Ukrainian and foreign journalists are being systematically kidnapped, while Russian journalists are allowed to operate in the areas controlled by the illegal armed groups. A military helicopter was destroyed with a man-portable air defence (MANPAD) guided missile. It should be understood that peaceful protesters cannot buy MANPADs in shops. Representatives of the military verification mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were taken hostage in Sloviansk. The detention by force of international observers is yet another testament to the criminal and terrorist nature of the separatist armed groups.

Their bodies, mutilated by torture, were found in the Torets River in the vicinity of Sloviansk. Volodymyr Rybak disappeared on 17 April in Horlivka after he tried to remove the separatists' flag from the building of Horlivka City Council. A video of the kidnapping, as well as audio recordings of phone conversations intercepted by Ukraine's Security Service, provided sufficient proof that terrorist leaders, notably the self-proclaimed mayor of Sloviansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, and the military commander of the terrorists, the Russian agent Igor Strelkov, were involved in the murder.

Last week, we all heard intensified militaristic rhetoric from senior Russian officials, including President Putin, Minister Lavrov and Minister Shoigu, threatening to send Russian troops into the territory of Ukrain under various pretexts. Defence Minister Shoigu reported the start of new military exercises by battalion tactical groups from the southern and western military districts of the Russian armed forces in connection with ""the deteriorating situation in southeastern Ukraine"".

First, Russia should withdraw its army from Ukraine's borders. Secondly, it should make a high-level statement calling on its prote'ges to free all hostages, to disarm and to vacate all seized administrative premises. It also has to condemn all terror and violence committed by those groups and to disassociate itself from such activities. Thirdly, it should stop its war-like rhetoric and start to act in a constructive and civilized manner.

In fact, it is Russia that has taken further dangerous steps aimed at fomenting instability in Ukraine. It has directed paramilitary actions in Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Lugansk and other towns in eastern Ukraine. Russian military jets and helicopters have made incursions into Ukrainian airspace. Russian armed forces have held further military exercises on Ukraine's border.
These are all clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine."

The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation has asserted that Russia has a legal basis to intervene in Ukraine in accordance with the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. This is a claim that takes Russia's distortion of international law to a new level. There is no justification or legal basis whatsoever for invoking Article 51. Russian nationals are not under threat in Ukraine - a fact that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions, including by the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission and by the Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). This is deeply irresponsible rhetoric intended to threaten and intimidate the Ukrainian Government and provide a bogus pretext for further illegal breaches of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity."

The United Kingdom condemns the abduction at gunpoint and public parading of an OSCE Vienna Document inspection team and its Ukrainian escorts.
We call upon those responsible to ensure the safe treatment and immediate release of the team, and we urge Russia, itselfan OSCE member, to use its influence to ensure that this happens without further delay.
On 17 April, talks between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and the European Union succeeded in agreeing steps to reduce tensions. The United Kingdom welcomed that agreement and the opportunity it offered for restoring stability in Ukraine. But this opportunity has been spurned. Since 17 April, the actions undertaken by Kyiv and Moscow stand in stark contrast. Let us consider the facts."

By contrast, Russia has refused to use its influence to restrain armed groups in the east. In fact, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated on 23 April that Russia will not call for these illegal militias to put down their arms and vacate buildings.

These abuses include at least 11 kidnappings, among them several Ukrainian and international journalists, and the torture and murder ofa Ukrainian local official and two other local people. The deplorable shooting yesterday of the Mayor of Kharkiv was another sign of the violence being instigated against those who have opted to support a united Ukraine."

One day, they brandish an alleged letter from the Head of State who is on the run, and only an unsigned version of that letter is released, disappearing as quickly as it appeared. The next day, they recall the issue of Kosovo. Finally, after what was probably a feverish search through the archives, they even exhume a decolonization case from 1976: the question of Mayotte. They are trying so hard to use all available means in Moscow that they do not want to see that in the latter example, Russia having taken the opposite position from the one it is taking today, that shaky comparison - even if one accepts it - proves that Russia was wrong in 1976 or is wrong now, in 2014.
It must choose.
I think, however, that my Russian colleague and I will find common ground in a key sentence from the speech of the Soviet Permanent Representative in 1976 on the question of Mayotte, who said: ""Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the integrity territory of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.""

That does not apply to us; it is a phrase taken from the foreign policy arsenal of the United States. Ms. Power spoke of truth. The world would be very interested to know if Washington, DC, would in fact tell the truth about its role in the development of the crisis in Ukraine. Finally, Ms. Power spoke of dreams and aspirations. But why has she negated the right of the people of Crimea to express their will tomorrow during the referendum? To conclude, one of our colleagues said that Kyiv had extended a hand to Moscow and that we had refused to reciprocate. But the problem is not with Moscow; it has to do with the fact that Kyiv should have been the one to extend a hand to its people and regions, instead of intimidating them with repression and banning the use of the Russian language. Why, for instance, was the constitutional assembly not convened, and in reality, in the course of the constitutional process, it was not proved that the ideology and practice of radical nationalism did not prevail in Kyiv? It is unfortunate that much time has been lost.
Nevertheless, we would appeal to all to put an end to the confrontation and to begin constructive cooperation with a view to a long-term settlement of the situation in Ukraine, in the interests of all of the people, including those in the eastern and south-eastern regions.

Alhough I was shocked, sadly I cannot say that I was surprised. Horrific allegations against peacekeepers have surfaced almost every year for over two decades - in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in C6te d'Ivoire, in Haiti, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and now inthe Central African Republic. The most harrowing abuse demands the most steadfast response.
Each and every victim could tell us that for too long our response has fallen short. Today I hope that finally we have turned the page and begun to make amends.
We cannot be having this discussion again - not in 20 years' time, not in one year's time. What we need now is swift and systematic implementation of this resolution, implementation that brings justice for the victims and ends the sickening cycle of impunity. This is not about collective punishment, nor about penalizing the many for the sick acts of the few. This is about taking serious action in the face of serious allegations, about acting decisively against any pattern of abuse in any part of the world."

I also take note of the very important comment that Egypt made, of the admission that the measures contained in the resolution - measures requiring accountability - would not have been passed by the General Assembly. We agree; the General Assembly has been totally paralysed. There are countries within the negotiations that are going on as we speak that have tried to water down the recommendations that the Secretary-General has made. It would be one thing if we were succeeding, if the system was working.
We come in here every day; we lament, we condemn.
We condemn the abuse and we condemn the lack of accountability, and then we go to the General Assembly and some of us try to water down provisions to try to strengthen the system. What is up with that? One cannot simultaneously try to water something down in the General Assembly and then complain when the body that sends peacekeepers out to try to protect people actually takes responsibility for the fact that some of those who were supposed to do the protecting are committing sexual abuse. We cannot have it both ways."

So I think that it is very, very strange to hear Member States call on the one hand for more aggressive action or more accountability and then try to punt the issue to a body that for years has been unable to come to a consensus; and with several countries, again including countries on the Council, trying to water down what happens in the General Assembly, no reasonable person could expect a different result."

We and the civilians that they protect with their bravery are completely indebted to them for their service. As I did yesterday (see S/PV.7642), I would single out those members of the Council that have contributed so many peacekeepers, including Egypt, Senegal, China, Uruguay and, of course, the United Kingdom, which is becoming involved again. As a country that does not contribute a lot of troops, we are in awe of their service. To the victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers, we pledge that we will do better.
We will do better to ensure that the Blue Helmets we send as their protectors will not become perpetrators.
That is what we are striving for. But if they do, this resolution demands that we, the Council, ensure that the people who commit such violations, who violate the good name of the United Nations and the good names of their countries, be held accountable."

Our draft resolution does not dictate how any Member State should go about investigating allegations or punishing those perpetrators found within their own systems to be guilty. But it does clearly state - finally - that there would be real consequences if the concerned troop- or police-contributing country failed to credibly respond to the allegations against its personnel. Under the draft resolution, a non-response is simply not an option. Our draft resolution outlines broad, objective criteria for troop- and police-contributing countries to satisfy, as appropriate, in the event that their personnel are the subject of an allegation or allegations. Those criteria relate to countries not taking any of the following steps, namely, not investigating an allegation or allegations, not holding accountable somebody who has been found to be a perpetrator, or not informing the Secretary-General of the actions that the State has undertaken.
In the draft resolution, which will come up for a vote shortly, the failure to do any one of those things should trigger the replacement provision set out in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution owing to non-response."

For example, under the Egyptian provision, if a country merely sends a letter to the Secretary-General, after receiving an allegation or allegations, that it has chosen not to investigate, giving no reason, but informing the Secretary-General according to that provision, and if it does nothing else, it would be in compliance with the draft resolution as amended by Egypt. That would be enough. If a Member State investigated and determined that an individual committed an act of sexual abuse and exploitation but does not hold the perpetrator accountable, it would actually be in compliance with the draft resolution as Egypt would have it amended."

The collective gets the blame when the individual is not held accountable, and Egypt's proposed amendment would make it less likely that we would see individual responsibility."

The reason for that is obvious. Our aim is not to repatriate contingents, but to protect the victims and prevent the repetition of aggressive acts. It is therefore necessary to investigate such matters as soon as possible or inform the Secretary-General of the measures taken. The perpetrators must be brought to justice and serve their sentences.

Sexual abuse cannot and should no longer be treated as a simple disciplinary or behavioural problem and tackled at the administrative level. The United Nations had to provide a political and operational response to the allegations made and confirmed cases by providing clear guidelines to commanders and troops deployed on the ground.

I would also like to stress how important it is that every effort be made to assist the victims of such crimes, in line with the compliance of Egypt and every other State Member of the United Nations with our zero-tolerance policy.
The Egyptian delegation chose not to vote against today's resolution 2272 (2016) out of our sincere belief in the importance of many of its provisions, which are designed to deal with repeated cases of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations.
Despite the unilateral approach to the negotiations on the draft resolution, we have chosen not to vote against it. Throughout the negotiations and during yesterday's briefing on the subject (see S/PV.7642), my delegation has consistently pointed to the need to differentiate between, on the one hand, condemning and combating sexual exploitation and abuse and, on the other, tarring entire States and the troops they contribute with the same brush. The way that peacekeeping troops and troop-contributing countries (TCCs) have been libelled is completely unacceptable. It has a drastic and negative effect on the troops' morale and demonstrates contempt for the sacrifices of tens of thousands of peacekeeping personnel operating under extremely difficult conditions."

All States Members of the United Nations are represented in the General Assembly, including the TCCs. Therefore, taking action on this matter in the Security Council rather than in the General Assembly illustrates ulterior motives aimed at capitalizing on the fact the major troop-contributing countries are absent from this organ, in order to adopt a resolution that never would have been adopted in the organ designated with responsibility to confront sexual abuse and exploitation. It would have been more appropriate if United Nations bodies had focused on addressing the root causes of the problem by providing sufficient predeployment training to peacekeeping forces, ensuring the separation of United Nations camps from the local population, avoiding prolonged rotation and providing adequate living conditions, among other things."

The Right Sector and those who say the demonstrators should be killed are not bandits; they are simply the political elite of Kyiv. Are not those who are protesting in eastern Ukraine able to do so without Russia's say-so? Do they need Russia to say that events in Kyiv are unacceptable before they are able to grasp that? When radicals come to tell the miners of that region that they will establish their own order - surely the miners can understand that without a hint from Russia? Are the protesters able to understand how bad things have become only when Russian agents come to explain the situation to them?
Do their own life experience and understanding of the situation in their own country count for nothing? How will those things influence them? Secondly, with regard to the statement made by my American colleague Ms. Power, she did not mention her view on the decree to use armed force in eastern Ukraine. I hope that, as the Ukrainian representative has called for, following today's discussion some Western colleagues and partners will pick up the telephone and call their leaders and those in Kyiv with whom they enjoy influence, who may not act unless they get the green light from Western capitals.

Ukraine has strong evidence of the involvement of the Russian special service forces, as was mentioned in a statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine made public early today.

As we were informed by the Vice-President's Chief of Staff, he said, ""For God's sake, just do not use force. Call off your forces from the centre of Kyiv"". That was what Mr. Biden said.

Ukraine's response to those provocations has been one of restraint under intolerable threats to its stability and independence. There is no evidence of actions directed at Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine that could possibly justify an intervention by Russia. Nor is there the generalized anarchy claimed. The ongoing work of the special mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is all the more important for providing an objective account of the situation in eastern Ukraine, and we welcome the information that the number of monitors will be significantly increased in coming days.
International condemnation of Russia's actions against Ukraine in the past six weeks has been resounding. General Assembly resolution 68/262 unambiguously condemned the threat and use of force in this manner as contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and to Russia's specific treaty obligations to Ukraine. Many countries, including my own, have imposed unilateral sanctions to register the depth of their concern. Repeated calls for de-escalation have been ignored."

We cannot look on while small groups of armed people, headed up, inter alia, by agents from the Russian Federation, seize State buildings and take weapons to hand out. Indeed, those are terrorist operations that have been specially organized and orchestrated.
Mr. Churkin is absolutely right, there is not much time left at all, there is just about an hour and a half. It is just as easy for him to call his President and say a few simple things to him as it is for me to do so, so I will repeat them here. The statement that Mr. Churkin has referred very negatively to several times today was made by the acting President, Mr. Turchynov, and was addressed to those people who are now creating tension in those towns, the terrorist groups of separatists.

That call was supported by the three major reviews carried out recently in that area. We have also seen tangible evidence of the importance of the role of women in their countries, especially in Liberia, Malawi and Central Africa, where women are successfully governing.
Second, there are large gaps in terms of the Council's resolutions and their follow-up. We therefore need to adopt a methodology that will enable us to bridge those gaps so as to ensure the comprehensive implementation of those resolutions. We also need to step up the role of the Informal Experts Group set up in resolution 2242 (2015)."

I point out also the exaggeration of the link with human rights and international humanitarian law, because it weakens the means for providing available protection in times of peace as well as in times of war. I reiterate that there is the problem of politicizing some of the issues linked to the two regimes of international law that I have mentioned. There are also problems with regard to the infringement of national sovereignty, and sometimes we rely on information that is unofficial and lacking precision. That distracts our attention from the issues that concern us, to their detriment, in particular the participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution."

But women in Africa continue to face, and to overcome, systemic obstacles to their political participation at all levels of decision-making. In February 2013, for example, 11 countries in the Great Lakes region of Africa signed a peace accord to address decades of violence in eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region was a landmark document to be sure. But it was also negotiated and adopted without any women having participated in the negotiations. The technical committees formed to oversee the implementation and the monitoring of the agreement also did not include any women. In March 2013, recognizing the absence of women in the formal process, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region convened consultations with women leaders and civil society groups across the region, seeking to link their community-level effort in building peace to the regional and the national implementation committees.
In January 2014, the Great Lakes Women's Plaform for the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework was launched by the Special Envoy, and it provides grants to women's organizations already working to implement peace in the region. We applaud the dedicated leadership by the United Nations and the countries of the Great Lakes region for recognizing that women were missing from the table and for taking the steps necessary to change that."

The long-term success of peace processes depends upon greater respect for human rights and improved prospects for development. Where gender-based violence is a major feature of conflict or has escalated in the aftermath thereof, it poses a unique challenge to peacebuilding efforts. In other words, it bears repeating that gender equality is a security issue, and thus a strategic imperative for the Council's work.
More often than ever before, we are confronted with the unspeakable: the egregious use by violent extremist groups, such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, of gender-based violence, not to mention kidnapping and slavery, which are strategically employed to achieve their aims. The abduction of over 250 Chibok girls from a school in northern Nigeria by Boko Haram militants in April 2014 and that militant group's ongoing use of women and girls as suicide bombers remain tragic reminders of how extremist groups are manipulating gender to achieve their ends."

Our efforts to support survivors of gender-based violence across Africa will be incomplete unless we also commit to fighting impunity. It is for that reason that the United States has supported mobile courts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has led to 1,924 trials and 1,336 convictions of gender-based violence since 2009. United States assistance has also supported the training of 5,505 providers of services to survivors, strengthened 1,103 local organizations serving gender-based violence-affected populations and provided 20,125 gender-based violence survivors with a holistic package oflegal services."

A study on assessing women's inclusion and influence on peace processes by the Inclusive Peace and Transition Initiative of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva revealed that when women have been included in peace processes, as in Burundi, Somalia, Darfur and Kenya in recent years, their inclusion was mainly owing to normative pressure applied by women's groups and their international supporters.
Our words and resolutions and debates therefore do have an effect on the ground, where it counts the most. Let me give just one small example of where the engagement of the international community has had a strong impact - actually, not such a small example, but an important example. In Sierra Leone a programme sponsored by the United States to strengthen women's local political participation became a strong vehicle for empowing women during the 2014 Ebola outbreak.
The women there leveraged their convening authority to host outreach sessions with health-care providers and local populations on the Ebola response. The effort ultimately yielded important recommendations for commmunity-led Ebola responses, standards that were adapted by the Government of Sierra Leone."

A good example of cooperation is the African Union's five-year Gender, Peace and Security Programme for the period 2015-2020. In order to achieve results in implementing the agenda on women and peace and security, there needs to be a balanced, system-wide approach that provides for the full-fledged participation of women in peace processes throughout the continent and in post-conflict reconstruction. No less pressing is the need to ensure the effectiveness of efforts to deal with violence against women during armed conflicts in Africa. There is also a need to ensure that the inclusion of gender aspects in our work on the ground does not become an end in itself and is not only declarative in nature. We should aim at achieving real results. In that context, it is important to bear in mind that national plans of action for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) cannot be used as an instrument for assessing the policy of States in terms of their gender-promotion policies. We need to bear in mind that the protection of women during the course of armed conflicts and steps to afford them equal opportunities for participation in efforts to achieve peace and security are the primary responsibility of the States involved in such conflicts."

The African continent was tragically and repeatedly struck by the recent attacks in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, as well as by the constant deadly attacks of Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al-Shabaab in Somalia in particular. We know women are victims of intolerable violence on a daily basis that is an affront to the human conscience. Terrorist groups target them, exploit them, reduce them to sexual objects and sell them in public squares or online. Women are objects of a parallel economy, victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation purposes and the trafficking in them finances the activities of terrorist groups.
That is the very condition of women and their rights, which are denied. Above all, we must give women the means to reverse that logic of control, so they can make decisions about their bodies, their lives and the society in which they live.

Women who have suffered the violence of conflict are often marked by a considerable post-conflict stress: they bear the stigma of sexual violence. We must ensure that they are able to return to their societies and their communities of origin. That return is often violent. Husbands, families and the labour market all reject them. Therefore, it is crucial that women who are liberated from those armed groups should enjoy -just like men or soldiers - disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes. Similarly, it is necessary for security sector reform (SSR) programmes implemented in post-crisis situations to take into account women and gender issues. Without that proper rehabilitation, women will remain marginalized and represent a gap in the rebuilding of societies. It is time for DDR and SSR to become more female-oriented.
That is why France, within the framework of its national women and peace and security programme, covering the period 2015-2018, has contributed to several programs in Africa, devoted to, among other things, social cohesion, education, access to justice for women in post-conflict situations on the continent."

In that regard, we recall resolution 2242 (2015), which calls upon the Secretary-General and Member States to double the number of women in military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping operations over the next five years. Female peacekeepers are uniquely well placed to build trust with local communities and to address sexual and gender-based violence. They also serve as role models to inspire women and girls to seek more rights and participation in our societies."

Sexual violence in conflict remains a serious concern for vulnerable populations impacted by war around the world, predominantly women and girls. Despite the strong African commitment to fighting sexual and gender-based violence, serious crimes against humanity, involving rape and sexual slavery, continue to occur in some regions of Africa. Brazil strongly condemns these abhorrent violations. We have long upheld the imperative to pursue accountability for serious crimes and abuses against women and girls, including but not limited to sexual and gender-based violence."

This was the first ICC case to specifically focus on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and should serve as a powerful deterrent to would-be perpetrators.
As the current Chair of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), I am deeply committed to gender equality in all political and security processes.
A specific concern are the human rights of women of African origin, who are often subject to discrimination and prejudice outside Africa. In this spirit, Brazil and the United States co-organized last week a CSW side event on the racial identity of women of African descent in the diaspora, in the context of the 2015-2024 International Decade for People of African Descent.
We believe that visibility and self-representation are powerful strategies for tackling racism and injustice."

In 2003, her group Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace successfully pressed Charles Taylor to attend peace talks. Talking afterwards, she said, ""We are now taking this stand to secure the future of our children, because we believe, as custodians of society, tomorrow our children will ask us, 'Mama, what was your role during the crisis?""' ""What was your role during the crisis?"" The answer to that question for so many women in Africa is not negotiator; it is not envoy; it is not delegate even, and that needs to change. It is not just about ending gender inequality. It is not just a women's issue; it is a peace issue. When women's voices are heard in peace processes, in negotiations and in State-building, the chances of a lasting peace increase. If we are serious about truly resolving conflicts and preserving peace - not just for hours, but for generations - we must heed the words of Leymah Gbowee and our briefer Paleki Ayang. They demonstrate just how powerful community-based activism can be. Just think how powerful those women's voices could have been had they actually been in the room at key times in peace processes. So, whether in Africa or in any other part of the world, we need to make sure that women are playing the fullest role in conflict resolution. I am proud that all future United Kingdom-hosted peacebuilding events will ensure that women's voices are heard. If the rest of the Council were to follow suit, then we would send a strong message to the rest of the world."

That means delivering on the commitments we made in resolutions 1325 (2000), 1889 (2009), 2242 (2015) and so many others because breaking down barriers facing women in peace talks requires breaking down barriers facing women across society. It means helping girls stay in school, improving health care and, yes, tackling sexual Violence. At its heart, it is about ending discrimination against women. We all have a part to play. In Somalia, the United Kingdom is helping make health services available to over 1 million Somali women and children, but also providing legal assistance to thousands of Somali women and will soon be supporting initiatives that boost their participation in politics too."

That is why the United Kingdom is contributing $1 million to the Global Acceleration Instrument for Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action (GAI). By funding the GAI, we can all offer material support that can break down those barriers.
In Burundi, a network of women mediators was able to deal with 5,200 local conflicts in 2015. That is over 14 a day. Thanks to the GAI, they are now scaling up their activities. At a time when the Council has been so frustrated by the crisis in Burundi, it is heartening to see how powerful women's civil society can be in their local mediation efforts."

When the Council visited Mali, Guinea Bissau and Senegal earlier this month, there was not a single female representative of the Council on the trip. And even at Headquarters in New York, only two of the 15 Security Council member countries are represented by a woman at this debate.
Since we call upon Africa's leaders to do more to bring women into conflict prevention and resolution, let us also heed the call ourselves. What signal does it send when the primary body for preserving international peace and security only has one woman among its 15 permanent representatives. What message does it send to that young girl in Somalia who dreams of becoming president, or to those who want to answer the question ""What was your role?"" with something other than ""survivor""? If we want half of the world's population to have a say in conflict prevention and resolution, then let us begin in this building. That is why the United Kingdom has been clear that we need as many credible women as possible to apply to be the next Secretary-General. We have had three so far and I hope that there are more to come."
